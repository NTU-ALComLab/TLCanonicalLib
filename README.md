The canonical threshold libraries of 2 to 8 input variables are constructed with the canonicalize procedure that iteratively minimizing maximum weight via ILP without symmetry detection preprocess.[1]

The threshold libraries of 2 to 5 input variables are constructed from lists of NPN functions.

The threshold library of 6 input variables is constructed by first enumerating all 6-input unate functions, converting them into threshold functions, removing redundant NPN equivalent functions by checking their weights and threshold value, and finally applying the canonicalization algorithm.

The threshold libraries of 7 and 8 input variables are constructed by first enumerating 8- and 9-input self-dual threshold functions with the L2 lattice[2], cofactoring to obtain all 7- and 8-input threshold functions, and finally applying the canonicalization algorithm.
