The canonical threshold libraries of 2 to 6 input variables are constructed with the canonicalize procedure that iteratively minimizing maximum weight via ILP without symmetry detection preprocess.
The threshold libraries of 2 to 5 input variables are constructed from lists of NPN functions.
The threshold library of 6 input variables is contructed by first enumerating all 6-input unate functions, converting them into threshold functions, and then removing redundant NPN equivalent functions by checking their weights and threshold value.
